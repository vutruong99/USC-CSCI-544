# USC-CSCI-544

This repository contains my work in USC's Natural Language Processing course. Below are some of the problems that I worked on:
* Sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using SVM, Perceptron, Logsitic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Part-of-speech tagging using Greddy and Viterbi decoding
* Sentiment analysis using Word2Vec embeddings and Neural Networks (FNN, RNN)
* Named entity recognition using BLSTM and Glove embeddings
