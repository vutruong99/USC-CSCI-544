Python version used: 3.8.8
Estimate run time: 4 minutes

Instructions to run the code:

1. Place the "data" folder and the extracted "glove.6B.100d.txt" file of the homework in the same directory as the two Python files (Task1.py and Task2.py)
2. Open the Terminal and go to said directory
3. Type python Task1.py to run predictions for Task1 and produce dev1.out and test1.out in that directory
4. Type python Task2.py to run predictions for Task2 and produce dev2.out and test2.out in that directory
5. If you want to train the model, uncomment the line "train()" before "test()" in the main functions in both Python files and rerun step 3 and 4.

Thank you!
